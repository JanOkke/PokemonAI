# GENERAL

if cant ohko - safest 2hko
like using tbolt into close combat since close combat has a negative effect and tbolt has a positive one
most damage if opponent can ohko
if opponent faster: prio, switch?

# MOVES

SWORDS DANCE - if cant ohko prefer unless opponent can ohko
WHIRLWIND - if enemy.stats_raises >= 2
JUMP KICK - dont use for finishing off, dont use if opponent has protecting move
SAND ATTACK - banned? (bcs accuracy)
THRASH - dont use for safe 2hko logic, unless it 2hkos - dont use if opponent has a ghost type
DOUBLE EDGE - dont use for finishing move, unless nothing else kills
ROAR - see Whirlwind
SING - if cant 2hko (and opponent can be put to sleep)
DISABLE -
